    """
    Our platform utilizes cutting-edge machine learning technology to diagnose crop health issues swiftly and accurately. With a diverse range of over 50 diseases covered, you can trust our system to identify issues from Apple Scab to Tomato Late Blight.
    ### How Does it Works?
    Simply upload an image of your affected plant, and our AI-powered algorithm will analyze it in seconds, providing you with a diagnosis and recommended actions to take.
    ### Technology we have used
    - NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
    - TensorFlow and Keras: To build and train deep learning models for image classification.
    - OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and manipulation tasks.
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and result analysis.
    - Scikit-learn: For evaluating model performance and generating classification reports.
    - Streamlit: For creating an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
